# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V.Isualize has instructed Omar and me to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type to get a better understanding of the disparities by city type: urban, suburban, rural. We were instructed to create a muiltiple-line graph and to write a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 

## Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
